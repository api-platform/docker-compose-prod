# Deploy API Platform in Production Using Docker Compose

**Deprecated:** the main API Platform distribution now support deploying in production using Docker Compose.
This repository isn't needed anymore.

This repository is a companion to the [API Platform Distribution](https://api-platform.com/docs/distribution).

This is a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) setup for deploying an API Platform project in production,
with (optional) [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) integration.
